#**_The Very Best Meeting Planer_**  

Planning meetings with [Doodle](http://doodle.com/ "Doodle") is tedious and difficult with more than a few people who each have many constraints. For this project we create a better meeting planner, one that fills the same purpose as Doodle, but more efficiently (in terms of user time and elapsed time to find a meeting time).

##About this folder
###What are these?
Large software development projects, irrespective of application, generate a large amount of associated documentation. If this were all to be printed, the documentation would probably fill several filing cabinets for moderately large systems; for very large critical systems, that must be externally certified, it may fill several rooms.  
A high proportion of software process costs, especially for regulated systems, is incurred in producing this documentation. Furthermore, documentation errors and omissions can lead to errors by end-users and consequent system failures with their associated costs and disruption. Therefore, managers and software engineers should pay as much attention to documentation and its associated costs as to the development of the software itself.  
The documents associated with a software project and the system being developed have a number of associated requirements:

  - They should act as a communication medium between members of the development team.
  - They should be an information repository to be used by maintenance engineers.
  - They should provide information for management to help them plan, budget and schedule the software development process.
  - Some of the documents should tell users how to use and administer the system.
  - They may be essential evidence to be presented to a regulator for system certification.

###What does we have?
Depends on the contract with the client for the system, the type of system being developed and its expected lifetime, the culture and size of the company developing the system and the development schedule that it expected, our documentation produced normally falls into two big classes:

  1. Process documentation: These documents record the process of development and maintenance. Plans, schedules, process quality documents and organizational and project standards are process documentation.
  2. Product documentation: This documentation describes the product that is being developed. System documentation describes the product from the point of view of the engineers developing and maintaining the system; user documentation provides a product description that is oriented towards system users.

####Process documentation
Type of process documentation include

  1. Requirements - Statements that identify attributes, capabilities, characteristics, or qualities of a system. This is the foundation for what shall be or has been implemented.

    - Version naming rules.docx

  2. Architecture/Design - Overview of software. Includes relations to an environment and construction principles to be used in design of software components.

    - state-design.docx
    - DatabaseDesign.docx

  3. Technical - Documentation of code, algorithms, interfaces, and APIs.

    - SingleAlgorithmDesign.docx
    - AllValues.xlsx

  4. Group minutes - Include group meeting minutes of all team members and sprint drawing experience of team leader.

    - Sprint 2 drawing experience.docx
    - All group minutes (yyyy-mm-dd-en.docx)

####Product documentation
