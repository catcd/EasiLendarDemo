Planning meetings with [Doodle](http://doodle.com/ "Doodle") is tedious and difficult with more than a few people who each have many constraints. For this project we create a better meeting planner, one that fills the same purpose as Doodle, but more efficiently (in terms of user time and elapsed time to find a meeting time).

##Why choose EasiLendar over Doodle?
Many people use Doodle and similar services to find times to meet. When the number of participants is more than three or four, this usually leads to one of two scenarios:  
  * A poll is distributed with a few proposed meeting times. Each prospective participant has conflicts with at least one of the proposed times. A flurry of email follows, then either a new poll is distributed with agreed candidate times, or else the meeting time is just settled by email.
  * To avoid the first scenario, a poll is distributed with many time slots. It is tedious to fill out, but at least it is possible to find an acceptable meeting time in a single round.
To avoid both of these scenarios, we have a meeting time arranger that can start with plausible meeting times, based on the schedules of prospective participants. To find plausible meeting times, the meeting planner draw from participants' calendars and possibly other sources of information.  
Drawing data from a person's calendar or schedule entails dealing properly with issues of privacy, confidentiality, and security.

##What can it do?
In particularly, it make it possible to find a meeting time in common with minimum disclosure of schedule information. An analysis of privacy and security is an integral part of the project.
####Common features
EasiLendar meeting planner have following features:
  * It draws from [Google Calendar](http://google.com/calendar/ "Google Calendar") and other widely used calendaring applications to help choose prospective meeting times.
  * It works for users who do not use the same calendaring application, or who choose not to share that information.
  * It respects privacy and security preferences.

####Advanced features
Many enhancements and extensions, including:
  * Draw from multiple calendar and scheduling systems, e.g., Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook, and include a well-documented protocol or interface for including additional calendar systems.
  * Support both web-based and email-based responses from prospective meeting participants, on both desktop/laptop and mobile platforms.
  * Support complex attendance requirements, e.g., “persons A,B, and C, are necessary; persons X,Y, and Z are invited but not necessary for the meeting; at least two of M,N, and O should be present.”
  * Distinguish between preferred meeting times and possible meetings times, flexibly ranking proposed times both by which attendees can attend and by how convenient the time is.
  * Handle time zones appropriately and robustly. For example, a teleconference at 3pm for the Seattle participants and midnight for participants in Lisbon and Milano would likely be less desirable than a meeting at 8am for the Seattle participants and 5pm for the Lisbon and Milano participants. Each prospective participant should have an opportunity to say which hours of the day are suitable for meetings.

##Requirements
####System
Features and usability of client interfaces that can be run in:
  * Android
  * IOS
  * Web browsers on Mac OS, Windows or other platform have HTML5

####Connection
EasiLendar work with a web database so the device must be connected to the Internet to use entire features. The users have been logging in and use Remember Me function can use some limited local features.
